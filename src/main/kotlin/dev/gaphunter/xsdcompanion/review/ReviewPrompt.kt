/**
 * Asks the user to rate the plugin on Marketplace, once, after the
 * plugin's own detector has flagged a real number of *distinct*
 * problems -- never on install, never on a timer, and never inflated
 * by the platform re-running the same inspection/line-marker pass over
 * an unchanged file (both `LocalInspectionTool.checkFile` and
 * `LineMarkerProviderDescriptor.collectSlowLineMarkers` fire on every
 * background highlight pass, not just on a real edit). [recordHit]
 * takes a small stable key per finding (e.g. `"$filePath:$lineNumber"`)
 * and only counts it the first time that exact key is ever seen, so
 * re-highlighting the same file repeatedly doesn't move the counter.
 *
 * Same "earn the ask" principle as other well-regarded plugins; never
 * re-asks once the user has either rated or dismissed it.
 *
 * Persisted via [PropertiesComponent] at the application level (not
 * per-project) -- how many distinct problems this plugin has flagged
 * isn't tied to any one project, and neither is whether the user
 * already answered.
